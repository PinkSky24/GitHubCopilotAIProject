# It is a simple .NET Core Web API for managing airports. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations using an in-memory database and includes Swagger for testing the endpoints. It was created by copilot IA

## All Prompts Used in Project Creation
1. Initial CRUD API Creation:
```
Create a CRUD operation in .net core, c# and database in memory. Add the swagger library for test endpoint.

The CRUD operation should, create airport, get airport, update airport, delete airport. 

Airport should have Id, Name, Country

By default we should have
Id 1, YYZ, Canada
Id 2, YUL, Canada.Create a readme.md with prompt used to create the project, also with a basic information about the project, endpoint, technology.Give me all steps needed and code needed
```

## Issues
